### Final Report
### Installation Guide
**Step 1:** Download and install XAMPP onto your device. Once itâ€™s installed, start the application and check to see if all services like (MySQL, ProFTPD, and Apache) are running in the services tab. Next you need to enable the network connection to localhost:8080 in the network tab. Finally you need to mount the directory in the volume tab. To check if XAMPP is running, the status will be green in the general tab and when you open the XAMPP website in the browser of your choice by typing localhost:8080 you will be met with a welcome page.  

**Step 2:** Create and implement the database using PhpMyadmin. For this step you need to make sure you follow all the appropriate naming conventions used for the schema and tables. When logging into PhpMyadmin the username needs to be root and you should keep the password blank. Then you create the schema naming it FinalProject. Next you need to create the tables Student, Courses, Grades, and Instructors. After creating the tables you need to add the columns based on the information in the relational schema. Make sure you follow phase two of the report to create the primary and forgien keys for the tables. Finally you need to import and transfer the sample data from the excel sheet provided into the database. 

**Step 3:** Download the code and run the website. First you need to download the code from our github, the folder should be called Data. Next you need to locate the htdocs folder in the Iampp directory. Once you find it you need to place the code folder into the htdocs folder. To run the project you need to type the ip address given to you at the general tab of the XAMMP application. The default one is 192.168.64.2 and then you need to write the file you're trying to run in the htdocs folder. For our project it should look like this: http://192.168.64.2/Data/data.html. Now you have successfully completed all the steps to install and run or project.

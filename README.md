### Installation Guide
Step 1: Download and install XAMPP onto your device. Once itâ€™s installed, start the application and check to see if all services like (MySQL, ProFTPD, and Apache) are running in the services tab. Next you need to enable the network connection to localhost:8080 in the network tab. Finally you need to mount the directory in the volume tab. To check if XAMPP is running, the status will be green in the general tab and when you open the XAMPP website in the browser of your choice by typing localhost:8080 you will be met with a welcome page.
